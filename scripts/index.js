    content: "I started out my Computer Science journey at Utah State University. I was working toward a degree in mechanical engineering and I had to take an intro to programming class. Dispite the fact that the class was in C++, I enjoyed solving the problems that that class presented me with so much that I changed my major to computer science and transfered to Utah Valley University to finish my degree. While at UVU I gained a deeper understanding of programming concepts. I took 4 classes in C++ and became very familiar with that language. I also took two web programming classes in which I learned HTML5, CSS, javaScript and Bootstrap. Two years before I graduated I took a class in Python, which quickly became my favorite programming language. I used python in all my classes from then on. Some of the projects I built during the last two years of my degree include, a heap manager in C++, an inference engine, an implementation of genetic algorithms, a neural network, a virtual machine and assembler, and a compiler that compiles a javalike language to assembly that runs on the virtual machine."
