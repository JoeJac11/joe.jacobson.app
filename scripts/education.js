Throuout this degree I had many opourtunities to build my coding skills and work in groups. I took four classes in C++, two web programming classes that focused on HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript, most of my classes for the last two years of my degree I chose to use Python. The capstone project for my degree was building every layer of abstraction required to make a high level language, similar to java, compile and run. This project included several steps. The first step was building a virtual machine and assembler that would translate assembly code into byte code and run the byte code. The virtual machine I built supports recursive function calls and multithreading. Once the virtual machine and assembler were built the next step was to build a compiler that took our high level language (a language designed by my professor called kxi) and compile it into assembly code that is then run on the virtual machine. My compiler supports recursive function calls, arrays, and objects all of which can be nested. As I was working toward earning my degree I also participated in a research project which involved building a platform to help blockchain and machine learning to work together to solve various problems."
